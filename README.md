Code Camp 2023 Rookie Kit 
=========================

This kit is for beginner or novice programmers to use as a starting point for
the [Southern Utah Code Camp 2023](https://southernutahcodecamp.com/). Be sure
to show the judges all of the cool things you add to it.

Dodgeball
---------

The project is called dodgeball, because the starter code
has a single ball object moving across the screen,
and a single player object in the middle of the screen. The user
controls the player object with the arrow keys.

It's up to you to imagine what you the game to turn into.
Do you want multiple objects that need to be dodged? Do you want
the objects coming from multiple directions? Do you want the
player to dodge the objects? Do you want the player to try to
catch the objects? Make the game as fun and as challenging as you
want it to be.

The [source code](src/) for the game is in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fractal13/code-camp-2023-dodgeball). 
A [few tutorials](doc/assignment_dodgeball.md) have been provided to get you started with adding features.
